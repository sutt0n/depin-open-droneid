# Description

This is basically a "miner" that scans for Remote ID packets being broadcasted over both Bluetooth LTE Announcements and WiFi Beacons. Those are commented out for now [1], but for the most part, they work (see the unit tests).

I won't be publishing the spec for Remote ID, as it's a document you must purchase; however, you can reverse engineer the spec from the various parsers. ðŸ˜Š

[1] They're commented out because this codebase was part of a project where the focus shifted from scanning drones to a memecoin and I did not have time to allocate as my paternity leave was ending. 

# Why Publish

I wanted to showcase my work. I put a lot of time into this, and I learned a lot and quite frankly, this was a very fun project.

The project ended up going nowhere, as communication and interest fizzled out.
